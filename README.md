#Basic Philosophy

The music blocks guide ***website*** will basically do these things:-

1. Serve as a tutor:-
   *  For first-timers the guide will teach them basics of music theory so that they can get started with music blocks as soon as possible just by lerning the basics.
   * For users who already know the basics, the advanced topics of music theory will be taught.
   * So basically, depending on the user's knowledge base and comfort level, there will be different kinds of content to learn from
2. Serve as a guide to use Music Blocks:-
   * The objective of the **GUIDE MODULE** will be to let users easily and intuitively discover the power of music blocks and make complex compositions starting from the ground up.
   * The guide will take users on a journey to use Music Blocks from ***Easy*** to ***Medium*** to ***Challenging***
   * A point to be noted about the website is that one of the ulterior motives behind the website will be kept in mind, i.e. A **polished easy-to-use and good-to-look-at-guide**.
3. Serve a PDF:
   * A **PDF** will also be bound with the website so that an offline version will be be availaible for download. In that case users will be totally independent of the need of internet connection.
   * All they will need is clone the source code of **Music-Blocks** and download the **PDF**, then their job is done.
   * Again, the PDF must be colourful, polished and easy-to-understand.
